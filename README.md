### Exploring correlations between lifestyle/diet patterns of different countries and the covid outcomes in those countries

This project is a surface level look into any possible relationships between covid outcomes and dies/lifestyle. My data analysis and project writup was done in a R markdown notebook (see [here](https://github.com/harrison-webb/covid-diet/blob/main/CovidDietAnalysis.Rmd)), and the data I used is from the Kaggle [COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset) by Maria Ren.
